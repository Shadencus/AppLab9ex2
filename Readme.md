### Persistence in Android

# Exercise 2

Thanks for cloning this repository.

We decided to provide the repositories for the exercises upfront so you can clone them before the lecture and have them ready to go. Also this way we hope to reduce the network traffic during the lecture.

This branch will remain empty. The base code for this exercise will be provided during the lecture.

After checking out the branch during the lecture you can revisit this ReadMe for the assignment.

## What's to do for now?

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Sync the project with Gradle
3. Resolve any issues that might occur with your project setup, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below
4. Run the app on your device or emulator: You should see a simple info screen.
5. Stay tuned for our upcoming lecture!

## Troubleshooting

### Android Studio version

Make sure to update your Android Studio to the latest version. Especially if you get an error regarding the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version.

### Module Errors

If Android Studio/IntelliJ does not recognize the android app module you could try to delete the `.idea` folder and reopen the project (which will recreate the `.idea` folder).

Also make sure that you open the project in it's root directory (the directory containing the `.git` directory and this `Readme.md` file).

### It still doesn't work

If you have tried the steps above and still have issues with the project setup, please contact us per email or at the start of the lecture.
